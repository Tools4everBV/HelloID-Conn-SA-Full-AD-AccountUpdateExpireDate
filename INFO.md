# Account Update Expire Date

This form sets an expiration date on an AD account. The expiration date works as a safety mechanism to ensure that dormant accounts do not remain enabled indefinitely. This form can also be used to update an account's expiration date in response to contract changes.

## Business Benefits

Users can update an account's expiration date without direct access to AD. By controlling access to AD and preventing orphaned accounts, security is improved.
