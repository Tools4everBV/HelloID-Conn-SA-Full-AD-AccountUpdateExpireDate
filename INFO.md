# Account Update Expire Date

By default, when HelloID Service Automation creates an AD account, the account will remain enabled indefinitely. This creates a risk of an orphaned account. This form solves the problem by setting an expiration date, ensuring that a dormant account will eventually be disabled. This form can also be used to update an account's expiration date in response to contract changes.

## Business Benefits

This form can update an account's expiration date without direct access to AD. By controlling access to AD and preventing orphaned accounts, security is improved.
